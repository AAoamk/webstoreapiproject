API project created for Oulu university of applied sciences 
Advanced Studies of Software Development Spring 2022 cloud integration task

the api url:
https://snutriwebstoreproject.herokuapp.com
the "openapi" type documentation in stoplight with interactable instructions
and environment for running calls to the api!
https://snutri.stoplight.io/docs/api-project/b3A6NDE0MjI3OTI-post-api-login
the OPENAPI.json file also has the pure openapi style code of the paths!

Running this code in local:

run npm install to get dependencies
create .env file to create local variables, the file should have

TOKEN_KEY = 32lettersecretkeyhere  
MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://yourlinkhere  
PORT = 80 (whatever port you prefer)  

api should run fine after this, you can check the stoplight documentation for further 
documentation on formatting of body elements and such to make the api calls

in case the server/openapi has deprecated feel free to contact me at snutri.dev@gmail.com or t9alal00@oamk.students.fi
